               <br><b>Manifesto</b></br>
               Elimisha stratizen aims to raise 5 million in order to grow into fully self-sustainable endowment fund. Now, more than evr, we must  not only find alternative sources of funds<br>, but bolster credibility and enhance visibility. with this in mind, i plan to:
               <br>1.Create a website/webpage within the university's website to make details of the fund easily accessible</br>
               <br>2.Write an annual report detailing how much money has been raised and how it has been used,<br> in order to improve accountability to the donors of the fund, mainly students.</br>
               <br>3.Come up with complimentary events throughout the year that may be held in order to raise additional funds in order to reach  the 5 million target.<br> These events will then culmiinate in a final Elimisha stratizen events, similar to the successfull stratifest held in the recent [ast.?</br>
               <br>4.Come up with a semi-annual newsletter to keep both donors and prospectivepatners up to speed with the goings-on within the funds.
